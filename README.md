# Weather-Station
Arduino Weather Station by the Pitt Vibrant Media Lab

This current branch holds the files necessary for running a web server that 

1: Makes a HTTP request from an arduino for the weather date (JSON) at a defined interval using a Job Scheduler (currently 1 hour). 
2: Takes weather data and serves it to a web site (so current readings are human readable). 
3: Uploads this data to a Google Spreadsheet. 

wStation.py contains all of python logic (getting, transforming, and serving the weather data) and code for building the web server 

Templates/index.html is defines the home pages structure

Static/main.css holds the css style sheets

## To run the app
To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable (In the directory with all of the file):

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py

$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. On Command Prompt:

C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py
And on PowerShell:

PS C:\path\to\app> $env:FLASK_APP = "hello.py"

Alternatively you can use python -m flask:

$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
